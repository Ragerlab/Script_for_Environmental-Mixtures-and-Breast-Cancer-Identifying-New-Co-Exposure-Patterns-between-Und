Script for 'Environmental Mixtures and Breast Cancer: Identifying New Co-Exposure Patterns between Understudied vs Breast Cancer-Associated Chemicals using Chemical Inventory Informatics'.

This study aimed to to identify environmental chemicals in use inventories that co-occur and share properties with chemicals that have association with breast cancer, highlighting exposure combinations that may alter disease risk. The analysis was broken down into 6 distinct *in silico* experiments. A overview of each experiment is supplied below, with further detail on each experiment provided in the corresponding folder above.


**Expermient_1: Data preparation and organization**

**Experiment_2: Clustering Analysis**

**Experiment_3: Structural Feature Enrichment**

**Experiment_4: Distributions of Enriched Features and Correlations** 

**Experiment_5: Cluster of Interest Identification**

**Experiment_6: Prioritization and Visualization of Clusters of Interest**
