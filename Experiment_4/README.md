**enriched_feature_dist.R**- This script reads in the clustered, organized presence/absence data **all_chems_w_cluster.csv** from the *output* of *Experiment_2**, the name/CASRN/DTXSID mapping from the *output* of *Experiment_1*, the enriched present strucutral features **present_enriched_chemotypes.csv** from the *output* of *Experiment_3*, and the ToxPrint fingerprints **CompToxChemicalsDashboard_all_ToxPrint_030721_pt1.csv**, **CompToxChemicalsDashboard_all_ToxPrint_030721_pt2.csv**, and **toxprint_V2_vs_DTXSIDs_no_fingerprint_042221.csv** from the *input* of *Experiment_3*. Chemicals with an unknown association to breast cancer (UCs) were isolated, then a histogram of the number of presently enriched features in each UC was generated and saved as **present_enriched_chemotypes_dist.png** in the *figures* folder.

**physchem_cor_dist.R**- This script reads in the clustered, organized presence/absence data **all_chems_w_cluster.csv** from the *output* of *Experiment_2**, the name/CASRN/DTXSID mapping from the *output* of *Experiment_1*, and the OPERA predictions for physicochemical properties **CompToxChemicalsDashboard_all_OPERA_032621_pt1.csv** and **CompToxChemicalsDashboard_all_OPERA_032621_pt2.csv** from the *input* folder of *Experiment_4*. The code loops over each of the 19 clusters of chemcials and calculates a spearman-rank correlation for each possible UC/BC chemical pair in the cluster. All correlations are combined into a large dataset and a histogram are generated. The dataset and histogram are saved as **all_correlations.csv** and **physchem_cor_dist.png** in the *output* and *figures* folders, respectively.
