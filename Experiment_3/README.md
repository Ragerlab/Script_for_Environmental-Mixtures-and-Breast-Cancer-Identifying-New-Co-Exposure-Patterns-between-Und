**toxprint_feature_enrichment.R**- This script reads in the *input* files **CompToxChemicalsDashboard_all_ToxPrint_030721_pt1.csv**, **CompToxChemicalsDashboard_all_ToxPrint_030721_pt2.csv**, and **toxprint_V2_vs_DTXSIDs_no_fingerprint_042221.csv**. ToxPrint fingerprints, which contain chemical strucutral feature information, are isolated for BC and NBC chemicals. Structural features that are notably more present and notably more absent in BC chemicals than NBC chemicals are found and deemed enriched. Enriched features were identified by evaluating Odds Ratios, Fisher's exact p-values, and the number of true positives, or BC chemicals that did/did not have the feature. The identified enriched features that are notably more present in BC chemicals are exported as **present_enriched_chemotypes.csv** and the identified enriched features that are notably more absent in BC chemicals are exported as **absent_enriched_chemotypes.csv**, both of which are written to the *output* folder.
